<p align="center">My CSS files to use with Firefox and Sidebery</p>

My goal with these settings was to create a minimalistic yet functional setup
with Sidebery tuned to match Firefox Default Dark Theme and optimise the
workspace. If you find any odd behaviour feel free to send a pull request.

### How to install?

1. In Firefox, go to `about:config` and set
   `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `True`. Make sure
   you have the
   <a href="https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html">chrome
   folder</a> within your Firefox profile
2. Get <a href="https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery/">Sidebery v5 (beta)</a> if
   you don't have it already installed
3. Copy `userChrome.css`, `darkTheme.css` and `private.css` to the chrome folder
4. Go to Sidebery settings and paste the content of my `sidebery.css` file into
   _Styles editor > Sidebar_
5. Enjoy your new setup!<hr>

Set these settings under appearance in Sidebery (optional but recommended):

<div><img src="image/sidebery-appearance.png"></div>

### Known bugs

- Due to a bug that has been present in Firefox for quite some time already, the
  autoshrink functionality isn't working as intended in Sidebery beta, so I
  decided to disable such characteristic until I find a workaround. Related
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1818517">issue</a>
  (thanks <a href="https://github.com/emiham">@emiham</a> for the heads-up)
- ~~When moving a tab, the tab position indicator doesn't follow the
  `margin-top` CSS rule for tabs~~ **_Fixed!_**
